#   ## Hello world

We're a team from cohort 5 of the [Code for Canada Fellowship program](https://codefor.ca/fellowship/) working with the [Canada Energy Regulator (CER)](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca).

[Code for Canada](https://codefor.ca) is a national nonprofit that connects government innovators with the technology and design community. Their fellowhip program embeds teams such as ours into government departments to use technology, design, and data skills to work on projects that matter to Canadians.

Our project will focus on improving the tools that Canadians use to participate in hearings regarding new energy projects regulated by the CER. It's still in early stages so stay tuned for updates about what that will look like more concretely.

Note: this site is under construction. Stay tuned for more information.
