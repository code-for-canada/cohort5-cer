## Team Members
Our team consists of three members. Learn more about us below:

### Ian Cappellani (Developer)
Ian is a full-stack developer with experience working on agile software teams. He’s passionate about web accessibility and has created courses on the topic for Learning Lions, a non-profit that provides IT skills to youth in Kenya. As a fellow at the CER, he’s looking forward to using his skills to help more — and more diverse — voices be included in the national energy conversation.

### Malik Jumani (Product Manager)
Malik has been a product manager and consultant for a number of digital companies and startups, and is also the co-founder of Dextra Innovations, a not-for-profit that develops prostheses for refugees. He’s excited to work at the scale of government, and wants to help the CER connect with stakeholders, so they can make better decisions about energy projects and the environment.

### Gillian Wu (UX Designer)
Gillian has worked in design and UX across startups, enterprise firms and agencies. She loves mentoring new designers and also volunteers with UnitedWomxn, a platform that amplifies the voices of youth and womxn in the Greater Toronto Area. As a fellow at the CER, she’s excited to use her design experience to make a positive impact for Canadians, and to help modernize existing processes within government.

## Our Guiding Principles
We came up with the following principles to help guide our work:

### Continuous improvement 
- Keep a growth mindset; instead of saying “no,” consider saying “yes, and...” 
- Pursue self-knowledge and self-learning 
- Feel free to explore areas outside of your domain knowledge 
- Share new knowledge, lessons, and processes 

### Open communication 
- Speak with the team about your work, ideas, roadblocks, and wins 
- Talk about your struggles and reach out if you need help 
- Don’t be shy to share your "crazy idea" with the team 

### Self-awareness and independence 
- Establish trust in each other's abilities 
- No babysitting, but check in with your team when it is necessary 
- If you make a mistake, own up to it and figure out ways to improve 

### Empathy for all
- Empathize with everyone, including the following groups:
    - Users 
    - CER folks 
    - C4C staff 
    - The rest of our C4C fellowship cohort 
    - Colleagues 

### Designing for sustainability and continuation 
- Develop solutions that can be used after we leave 
- Consider the full lifecycle of products and solutions 

### Digital first, not digital only (thank you CER cohort 3 team for this principle) 
- Not all users have access to tech, or high-speed internet 
- Be aware of the full experience of users & edge cases (service design) 

### Transparency in work 
- Work in the open  
- Collaborate closely with the CER staff 
- Show your process and learnings internally and externally so everyone can benefit 

### Respect by default 
- Be mindful of each other’s time and the time of our stakeholders 
- Be kind to one another  
- Take time for self-care
