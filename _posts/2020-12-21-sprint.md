For our sprint from December 21st to 24th, we are going to be working on the following tasks:
- Finish up our exploration of the online application to participate (ATP) form, including the admin view for this tool.
- Deliver a workshop about web accessibility to our team within the CER.
- Develop a survey to get user feedback about the CER's external website.
- Refine our understanding of who the users are of the participation tools on which our project focuses. This will be done by completing the second half of a persona workshop started last week.
- Check if there are any easily-identified accessibility improvements to be made on the CER's external website or in the online ATP form.
- Check if there are any easily-identified enhancements to be made to the above tools with respect to mobile device compatibility.
