For our sprint from January 4th to 15th, we are going to be working on the following tasks:
- Finish up our understanding of the current process that users go through to participate in hearings via the CER's online Participation Portal.
    - Done! After some technical difficulties, we were able to successfully apply to participate in a fake hearing.
- Work on getting a survey up on the external CER website to establish baseline user data and possibly collect suggestions and contacts for further research.
- Publish our first proper blog post on our Medium blog.
- Begin and/or finish up a few more blog posts (topics include working in the open and insights from workshops we've conducted or participated in).
- Conduct a prioritization matrix workshop.
- Conduct interviews with stakeholders within the CER.
- Continue planning our user research.
